## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧩 **Modular Blueprint Architecture**  
  Cleanly separates logic by feature or module — ideal for large, maintainable codebases.

- ⚙️ **Dynamic Plugin/Extension System**  
  Load third-party or in-house modules without editing the core codebase. Each extension can add its own views and assets.

- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Built-in roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) with easy customization. Secure critical routes with decorators.

- 🛠️ **Configurable Settings Management**  
  Admins can manage general site settings (title, description, theme, etc.) from the UI — no code changes required.
